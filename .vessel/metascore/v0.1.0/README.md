📣 This is an open community project and we are in need of skillsets of all kinds. Reach out if you'd like to help!

## Participating as a Developer

You should participate in Metascore, because gamers will be trying their hardest to get high scores on all the integrated games. [Developer readme](./developers.md).

*Sweet breakdown of the prize pool would go here.*

- Show up and play all of the games!!!
- Game scores are normalized, so games that tend to give higher scores won't have a bigger impact on your metascore.
- Earn a soulbound (non-transferable) “Rank Badge” NFT based on your performance!!
- Earn cronics NFTs, starverse NFTs, and more!
- Be aware, it is not a requirement for all games to integrate metascore, so not all games will grant you progress toward your score. We will post a directory of Metascore enabled games for you to reference during the hackathon.
- The meta leaderboards will update frequently, so keep your eye on them while you jockey for position on your quest to be the best!
- In order to discourage cheaters, we will require accounts to be verified by phone number or social account.
